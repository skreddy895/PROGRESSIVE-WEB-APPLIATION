The Modern Gadget Store is a beginner-friendly web application that I built to strengthen my frontend development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a simple e-commerce interface where users can view a list of tech gadgets like wireless charging pads, noise-cancelling headphones, and smart LED bulbs. Each product card is dynamically generated using JavaScript and displays key details such as the product name, image, price, and a short description. When a user clicks on a product, it reveals a detailed view showing specifications, warranty, and user reviews. I also implemented a service worker to enable offline access by caching core files, which gave me practical experience with Progressive Web App (PWA) features. The manifest file helps in adding the site to a userâ€™s home screen with a custom icon. All assets including images, scripts, and stylesheets are organized and loaded efficiently. Through this project, I learned how to manipulate the DOM, handle user interactions, and structure a responsive layout with basic CSS grid. This was a great opportunity for me to understand how real-world web apps work and how user-friendly interfaces are designed. I plan to expand this project in the future by adding search functionality, filters, and maybe even a simple cart system.
